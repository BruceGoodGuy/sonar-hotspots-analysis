# Sonar Hotspots Analysis  

## üìñ About  
**Sonar Hotspots Analysis** is a utility project designed to enhance the functionality of **SonarQube** by providing better support for analyzing **hotspot issues**.  

Since the current version of SonarQube being used does not fully support hotspot issue analysis, this project leverages the **SonarQube Web API** to deliver missing capabilities, such as:  
- Filtering hotspot issues by **date range**, **severity**, or **author**  
- Tracking and managing hotspot issues over time  
- Focusing specifically on **hotspot-related analysis**, while depending on the connected SonarQube server  

The goal of this project is to simplify the process of auditing and monitoring hotspot issues in codebases.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution / Project Status  
This project is currently **on hold**.  
Development was paused due to health reasons (I got sick and lost motivation for coding). Work will resume once conditions improve.  

## üöÄ Future Features (Planned)  
- Extended filtering options  
- Better visualization of hotspot trends  
- Integration with dashboards
